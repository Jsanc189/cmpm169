				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off with Terrain by Tiago on open processing found here: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/729536</p>
				<p>I was able recreate the code on a p5.js editor and commented each line to make sure I understood what each piece of code did.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>From the start, I felt like the terrain looked like waves of the ocean.  I made the "waves" look blue.  
					I also managed to make the color vary depending on the noise level the shape was being formed on.
					Thus, the ocean changes in color from blue to sea greens
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I have been feeling very inspired by the rainy weather at the time of making this piece, so I tried to implement rain drops coming down onto the water.
					I had some crazy lines that kept forming, so I ended up abandoning that idea in favor of snowflakes that look like they are falling toward the viewer.
					From there I added a moon background for the feeling of being on a winter sea at night.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I This project was challenging in trying to get anything to work.  My rain turned into snow, and my waves were showing the background.  
					There was a lot of putting out fires as they came up.  I think for the future, I would want to figure out how to make the snowflakes look more 3D, maybe 3D shapes?  
					I also was thinking the coloring could be darker further away from the moon, and have the moons reflection underneath it in the water.
