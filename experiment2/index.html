			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation, & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I took inpiration from the sketch at this link: https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_2_3_1_02.  I initially just retyped the code and wrote comments to myself about how I thought the code worked.  By doing this I was able to discern how the artist had placed 4 different types of lines onto the canvas and how they utilized input from the user.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I noticed that the original artist already had prefabricated lines inncluded as external files.  As a class we have yet to utilize outside file work, I decided to then make a similar style happen, but with shapes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>This part goes hand in hand with integration as most of my innovation came from saying "What happens if I do this instead?"  Most of those questions were what if I change the lines to shapes?  What if I don't want the user to click each time to make a pattern appear?  How do i change the shape withought using prefabricated external files?  How do I rotate a whole shape versus a line? All of the questions then had additional questions that ultimately led me to the final piece which is similar in thought, but executed differently to get a different pattern when compared to the original artist.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>On this project I went through each step very carefully.  From figuring out how to make shapes appear on the canvas to my end result, each step was done with a lot of testing and approaching the problem with the idea of asking “What happens if I do this?”  I think the highest point I had was getting shapes to appear in random colors on my screen.  Visually, it really added to my confidence, and I could see that through the representation of those shapes.</p>
				<p>I struggled a bit with figuring out how to make the shapes appear versus how the original author had done it.  They had prefabricated files, while I had to code it.  Thus I went back to the class’ basic commands list to figure it out.  I then struggled with how the shapes were rotating on the screen.  After some thought on previous lectures and really understanding how the canvas was behaving through the translate command, I figured out how to then change how far away the shape would spawn away from the origin (or the first two parameters it was given to create the shape).</p>
				<p>Overall, I am pleasantly surprised with what I came up with.  I profess myself as not that creative, but looking back on this project, I feel a small step towards that being an untruth.</p>
