			<h1>Experiment 6 - Text Art and Grammars</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this piece, I decided to start with an L system, since they seem to be very closely correlated with Grammars.</p>
				<p>I used I started with this example: https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/UoSg_99pH.  I rewrote the code with my own comments to understand what was happening.</p>
				<p>I also utlized this example: https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/BUU8t66TN to also expand the grammar utilizing an algorithm</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>From there I was able to create the original piece.  I combined the second example with the first to create a whole new way of making the pattern.</p>
				<p>I struggled a lot with figuring out how to make the system expand and incorporate a new look.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After I was able to make the two systems work together, I then started adding in new shapes and played with the scale.  I seemed to keep getting a very small looking piece on a big canvas</p>
				<p>I ended up scaling into the piece while also utilizing that value to manipulate the sizes of the new shapes I was introducing.  In addition, I changed how I translated through the world of the canvas for a new look.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Thinking on this piece, I just wanted to understand how an L system could be used to make a piece of art.  Although it is using letters, I found it interesting to be able to make patterns and expand them over and over.</p>
				<p>I think I struggled the most with trying to get th epiece to be "centered" in a way that made sense to me.  It still kind of looks like chaose, and given more time, I may try and find a way to make a pattern that looks less chaotic.</p>
