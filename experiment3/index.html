			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this art exploration with a piece by Yasai: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/494102.  I first rewrote the code out and commented each line to make sure I understood what the artist was doing.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>From the previous step, I started changing the shape of what was being traced out by a noise function that was being utilized.  I first started with a square.  While it did make a slight change, it wasn't very drastic.</p>
				<p>I then tried utilizing Triangles.  This ended up making a bunch of various size triangles move on my screen.  I decided to then try a Bezier Curve.  I ended up with an unexpected reaction that reminded me of sunlight.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After I saw the Bezier curve result, it reminded me so much of sunlight, I started implementing color pallets to try and replicate the moode of the sunlight.  I started with warmer tones, but realize I wanted more contrast</p>
				<p>After adding some contrasting colors and changing the background to a more complimentary color, I decided I wanted to have it look like it was streaming through the clouds.</p>
				<p>I coded in an array of clouds that move slowly back and forth at the top of the screen.  This took a lot of time and effort to figure out, as I initially wanted to use noise as well, but it did not achieve the effect I was after.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This entire project was done by myself.  The difficulties I had were initially getting the inspiration material to work.  Utilizing Chat GPT, I was able to find a work around to at least mimic the original work and understand how things operated.  From there, I just started messing around with the different shapes Noise could make.  It was a total accident how I got something that looked like sunlight at dusk.  It was so beautiful, that by the end, I was just making small changes to see how aesthetically pleasing I could get it (to myself).  
					This project also intimidated me at first.  After I got the initial simulation going, I was not sure where to go from there.  Only my just asking myself, “I wonder what happens if I do this?” and went and did that thing, did the piece change and take on a different form.  I ended up really enjoying the surprising things that happened when I changed something.
